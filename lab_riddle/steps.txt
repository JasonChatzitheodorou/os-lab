Give execution permissions to riddle with chmod +x riddle

Give extra hints with I_NEED_TECH_HINTS = 1 

Challenge 0: 
Created file ".hello_there" because of a system call that tried to open it.

Challenge 1: 
Remove write permission for .hello_there with chmod -w .hello_there

Challenge 2: 
Run ./riddle & so that it is in background and then kill -s SIGCONT $! to send the signal

Challenge 3: 
Set environment variable ANSWER to 42 with export ANSWER=42

Challenge 4: 
Create pipe with mkfifo magic_mirror

Challenge 5: 
Open file with file descriptor 99

Challenge 6: 
Create pipes with correct fd's -> ./pong

Challenge 7: 
Hard link so that .hey_there is actually .hello_there -> ln .hello_there .hey_there

Challenge 8: 
Create 10 sparse files with truncate and write on the last line -> ./big_data

Challenge 9: 
Code for server that reads request from client and sends back result of addition, 
run ./socket & and then as it listens run ./riddle

Challenge 10: 
Create secret_number and hard link then stop execution of riddle with Ctrl-Z, 		 
read from hard link the number, fg and paste it

Challenge 11: 
Open file secret_number, let riddle write to it and then read it and 
send number to stdin -> ./read_secret

Challenge 12: 
strace ./riddle then Ctrl-z when it starts waiting.
The mmap'ed tmp/riddle-XXXX file opened is always saved on a memory range 
that includes the memory location. The last 3 hex digits of the memory 
address are in fact the offset in bytes from the start of the file. If
it is 06f then vim tmp/riddle-XXXX and move cursor 111 times. On position 112
insert the character. Then fg %1 to restart job 

*Same thing can be done by Ctrl-z at strace ./riddle, run ./mem_char with
the 3 arguments and then fg %1 or whatever job strace was

Challenge 13:
./riddle, then ctrl-z, then ./sigbus_save, then fg %1, then press enter/random key.
This challenge tries to access memory that is not mapped and gets sigbus

Challenge 14:
Set the last living process ID to 32766 so that riddle will
be 32767 with the following command ->
sudo echo 32766 > /proc/sys/kernel/ns_last_pid; ./riddle
